# -Ion-Thruster-Project-Presentation
Overview:
Ion thrusters are electric propulsion devices that generate thrust by ionizing and accelerating ions. They offer high fuel efficiency and are ideal for long-duration space missions and satellite adjustments.

-->How It Works
   Ionizes xenon gas to create positive ions
   Accelerates ions using electric fields
   Produces continuous, low-thrust propulsion

-->Applications
   Satellite station-keeping
   Deep space exploration
   Long-term space travel missions

-->Benefits
   High specific impulse (fuel efficiency)
   Precise thrust control
   Suitable for extended missions
